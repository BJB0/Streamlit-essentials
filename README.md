# 🚀 My Streamlit Learning Journey + Showcasing some Projects

Hi there! 👋  
This repository documents my hands-on journey of learning Streamlit, along with a few showcase projects I built along the way.  
I used modern Python tools like `uv` to keep everything lightweight and efficient. The focus was on building real-world interactive apps using just core libraries like Streamlit, pandas— no unnecessary complexity.

Through these mini-projects, I worked on creating simple UIs, handling real datasets, and building fully functional dashboards — all from just a single Python file per app.

## 🎯 What I Focused On

- Setting up and running Streamlit apps efficiently with `uv`
- Designing interactive components like forms, sliders, dropdowns, and buttons
- Structuring clean layouts using columns, sidebars, and expanders
- Loading, filtering, and displaying real-world data with pandas
- Building dashboards with KPI cards and charts using native Streamlit features
- Understanding the process of deploying apps to Streamlit Cloud

---

## 🛠️ What You Should Know Before Starting

- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Some familiarity with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (optional but helpful)
